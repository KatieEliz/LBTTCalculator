If the price is very low (below the first threshold), no tax is charged.

If the price is between the first and second thresholds, you pay tax on the amount over the first threshold.

If the price is between the second and third thresholds, you pay:
Tax for the amount between the first and second thresholds.
Plus tax for the amount between the second and third thresholds.
This pattern continues for higher thresholds.

---------------------------------------------

First range = threashold[1] - threashold[0] * rate[1] + second range = threashold[1] - price * rate[2] 

145000 - 250000 = 105000 * 0.02 = 2100 + 145000 - 300000 = 155000 * 0.05 = 2500
 
2100 + 2500 = 4600

Keep working out each range and add together, ending with price - threasshold[3] (last threashold)
